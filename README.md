<h1>Hello ML</h1>
- This is the front-end section of the project

<h3> Hello ML is a pet project where I combined the powerful Data Science and Machine Learning Python Libraries with Python backend framework <b>Django</b>. And I integrated the with the front-end section of the application that is built using Javascript Library <b>React</b>. </h3>

<h5>This Application takes a CSV file, a split ratio for splitting the dataset into training and testing data, and provides some <b>Regression</b> models which can
be selected based on the user's choice. The Application will get rid of missing categorical values, set Mean for missing numerical values, encode categorical values to numeric values suitable for ML algorithms, apply feature scaling to the numerical values to keep the values consistent, and then provide a download link for downloading the preprocessed CSV file and show
R<sup>2</sup> score for the selected models.</h5>
