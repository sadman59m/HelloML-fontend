Hello ML
- This is the front-end section of the project

<h3> Hello ML is a pet project where I combined the powerful Data Science and Machine Learning Python Libraries with Python backend framework <b>Django</b>. And I integrated the with the front-end section of the application that is built using Javascript Library <b>React</b>. </h3>

<h3>This Application takes a CSV file, a split ratio for splitting the dataset into training and testing data, and provides some <b>Regression</b> models which can
be selected based on the user's choice. The Application will preprocess the dataset and provide a download link for downloading the preprocessed CSV file and show
R<sup>2</sup> score for the selected models.</h3>
